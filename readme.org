* Project checklist
- [ ] Create a git repository
- [ ] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
- [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages (using conda)
- [ ] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
- [ ] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
- [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
- [ ] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
- [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project
- [ ] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code
- [ ] Setup version control for your data or part of your data
- [ ] Construct one or multiple docker files for your code
- [ ] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended
- [ ] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
- [ ] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
- [ ] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if
      you can optimize your code
- [ ] Use wandb to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code
- [ ] Use pytorch-lightning (if applicable) to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your code
